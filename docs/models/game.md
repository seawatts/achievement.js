State
--------
* Hidden -  means that details about the achievement are hidden from the player. The Games services provides a generic placeholder description and icon for the achievement while it's in a hidden state. We recommend making an achievement hidden if it contains a spoiler you don't want to reveal about your game too early (for example, "Discover that you were a ghost all along!").

* Revealed - means that the player knows about the achievement, but hasn't earned it yet. Most achievements start in the revealed state.

* Unlocked - means that the player has earned the achievement.
